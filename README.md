# VanityFair
fun with typesetting: Thackeray's Vanity Fair

# Author
- **Thackeray** (he's dead)

# License
I think this is *public domain*, at least in all the important respects.

# Typesetting
- **Hogg** (with help from TeX and LaTeX)

# Notes
- I got the text file from Project Gutenberg at
`http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/599/pg599.txt`.  In case you
are web-challenged, I checked in the version I got in the `rawdata`
directory.
